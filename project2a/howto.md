# Testing the MIPS CPU

To test a MIPS CPU created in JLS, ensure that both the jls file you are testing, Mars.jar, jlsCircuitTester.jar, and the jlsCPUTester
script are all within the same directory. 

For windows, run:

```
jlsCPUTester.bat [jls cpu name] [test filename]
```

For linux/mac, run:

```
jlsCPUTester [jls cpu name] [test filename]
```
